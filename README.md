<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Book Reservation API

The Book Reservation System API is a RESTful web service designed to facilitate the management of book reservations for libraries or bookstores. It serves as the backend infrastructure for the book reservation system, providing endpoints for various operations related to books, users, and reservations.

Key features of the Book Reservation API include:

- **Book Management:** The API allows administrators to manage books, including adding new books to the system, updating existing book information, and deleting books when necessary. This ensures that the database of available books remains up-to-date and accurate.

- **User Management:** User accounts are an essential part of the reservation system, and the API enables administrators to manage user accounts. This includes creating new user accounts, updating user information, and deactivating or deleting user accounts as needed.

- **Reservation Handling:** The API provides endpoints for users to reserve books, view their existing reservations, and cancel reservations if necessary. Additionally, administrators can view and manage all reservations through dedicated endpoints, allowing for efficient oversight of the reservation process.

- **Authentication and Security:** To ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access, the API implements robust authentication mechanisms. This typically involves token-based authentication, where users and administrators must authenticate themselves with a valid token before accessing protected endpoints.

Overall, the goal of the Book Reservation System API is to provide a reliable and flexible backend infrastructure for managing book reservations, helping libraries and bookstores streamline their operations and provide better service to their patrons.

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| `start`      | Runs the Node.js application using `src/index.js` as the entry point. Can be invoked with `npm start`. |
| `test`       | Runs the build process and executes tests using Mocha.                                          |
| `build`      | Transpiles the source code in the `src` directory to JavaScript and outputs it to the `build` directory. |
| `start:build`| Starts the application after building it.                                                        |
| `build:dev`  | Transpiles the source code in the `src` directory to JavaScript and outputs it to the `dev-build` directory. |

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### üñ•Ô∏è Usage

The Book Reservation API simplifies the process of managing book reservations for libraries or bookstores. Here's how you can utilize it effectively:

1. **Authentication:**
   - Before accessing most endpoints, you need to authenticate yourself. Use the `/v1/user/login` endpoint with your credentials (username and password) to obtain a JWT token.

2. **Book Management:**
   - Utilize the `/v1/book-info` endpoints to manage books within the system:
     - Retrieve books: Send a GET request to `/v1/book-info`.
     - Add a new book: Send a POST request to `/v1/book-info` with the book details in the request body.
     - Update an existing book: Send a PUT request to `/v1/book-info/{id}` with the updated book details in the request body.
     - Delete a book: Send a DELETE request to `/v1/book-info/{id}`.

3. **User Management:**
   - Administrators can handle user accounts using the `/v1/user-info` endpoints:
     - Get users: Send a GET request to `/v1/user-info`.
     - Create a new user: Send a POST request to `/v1/user-info` with the user details in the request body.
     - Update an existing user: Send a PUT request to `/v1/user-info/{id}` with the updated user details in the request body.
     - Delete a user: Send a DELETE request to `/v1/user-info/{id}`.

4. **Reservation Handling:**
   - Users can reserve books through the `/v1/book-reservation` endpoints:
     - View existing reservations: Send a GET request to `/v1/book-reservation`.
     - Create a new reservation: Send a POST request to `/v1/book-reservation` with the book ID in the request body.
     - Cancel a reservation: Send a DELETE request to `/v1/book-reservation/{id}`.

5. **Swagger Documentation:**
   - Detailed information on available endpoints and their usage is provided in the Swagger documentation. Access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/v1/api-docs` in your web browser after starting the server.

By following these usage guidelines, you can effectively manage book reservations using the Book Reservation API.
